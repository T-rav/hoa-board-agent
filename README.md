# HOA Board Agent

A lightweight agent framework that monitors HOA emails, ingests attachments, tracks votes and issues, and keeps you updated via WhatsApp. Built with a persistent memory + skill framework, the agent maintains structured and semantic memory, allowing it to surface aging issues, vote statuses, financial exposures, and escalating threads — all interactively through chat.

Features:

Gmail ingestion and attachment parsing

Issue and vote tracking

Escalation and risk detection

Daily reflections / aging summaries

WhatsApp notifications and interactive commands

Extensible skill-based architecture for custom logic

Designed for deterministic pipelines with controlled LLM micro-functions for structured extraction and summarization.
